## My process

1. I started with the markup on index.html, complying with HTML5 semantic tags and standards as much as possible.
2. The styling provided by the testimonials-grid-section briefing was implemented first, followed by the classes I came
   up with on the
   markup.
3. I used Figma to acquire all the right dimensions involved in the layout and implemented them in the appropriate CSS
   classes.
4. The [CSS Cube](https://cube.fyi/) methodology was used when coding the stylesheet and some of the conventions from
   BEM were used when naming classes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Cube CSS methodology

### What I learned

- This project required a lot of work due to the sheer number of design exceptions everywhere. It's not like all cards
  followed the same patterns -- there were changes that had to be dealt with between each card and, for the same card,
  for each of the breakpoint viewport dimensions.
